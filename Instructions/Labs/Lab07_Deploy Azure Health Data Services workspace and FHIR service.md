# Module 5 Lesson 4 Lab 7: Deploy Azure Health Data Services workspace and FHIR service

## Overview

In this lab, you will deploy an **Azure Health Data Services workspace** containing a **FHIR service** instance. In addition, you will set up Postman as your application for testing the FHIR service API.

**FHIR service** is the core component for reading, writing, and querying structured health data in Azure Health Data Services. You may have heard of the predecessor to FHIR service – called Azure API for FHIR (Microsoft's first generally available FHIR PaaS solution). For this training, we will be focusing on the new Azure Health Data Services FHIR service, which has some big advantages over its predecessor (like transaction bundles, workspace level configuration, and performance improvements for search, import, and export).

**Azure Health Data Services workspace relationship with FHIR, DICOM, and MedTech services**

In the Azure health ecosystem, the Azure Health Data Services workspace is a logical container for associated healthcare service instances such as FHIR, DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine), and MedTech services. You can provision multiple FHIR, DICOM, and MedTech services in a single workspace to meet your solution needs.

The workspace also creates a compliance boundary (HIPAA, HITRUST) within which protected health information can travel. This means that [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/configure-azure-rbac), private network data transit with [Private Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-configure-private-link), and [event messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/events/events-deploy-portal) can all be configured at the workspace level – reducing your system management complexity.

## Learning objectives

In this lab, you will:

-   Explain the difference between workspaces and services in Azure Health Data Services
-   Use a template to deploy a FHIR service instance inside an Azure Health Data Services workspace
-   Create an AAD service client for Postman and grant it access to your FHIR service
-   Configure and use Postman for sending web API requests to your FHIR service

## Exercise 1: Deploy Azure Health Data Services workspace and FHIR service to your Azure environment

In the first part of this lab, you will use a template to deploy resources with the Azure Portal. This template will deploy
-   [Azure Health Data Services workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/workspace-overview)
-   [FHIR service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview)
-   [FHIR Loader (for Lab-09)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview)
-   [FHIR-Proxy (for Lab-13)](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-proxy)

1. [] To begin, open a new browser tab and navigate to the deployment form at +++https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fazure-health-data-services-workshop%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fdeploy%2Fdeployfhirtrain.json+++.

1. [] Select or fill in the parameter values (see image below).

    > [!ALERT] Important: In order to successfully deploy resources with this ARM template, the user must have **Owner** rights (see +++https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner+++)  for the **Resource Group** (see +++https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal+++) where the components are deployed. Before running the ARM template, it is recommended to create a new resource group first and check that you have Owner permissions. Once you confirm that you have Owner rights, then select that resource group in the dropdown menu when you fill out the deployment form.

    1. [] Accept the default Subscription and set the resource group to the training resource as shown. (The resource may be named differently).

    1. [] Enter a custom **Deployment Prefix**. This prefix will be prepended to the names of all created resources ("trn05" is shown as an example prefix).

    1. [] Change **Resource Location** to **eastus**.

    1. [] Make sure to select the **true** values as shown.

        ![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab07/L7P3.png)

1. [] Select **Review + create** when ready, and then select **Create** on the next page.

> [!NOTE] Note: This deployment typically takes 20 minutes. During the deployment, you can read the instructions linked in Step 2 below. When the deployment finishes, go ahead and proceed with those instructions.

To learn more about the resources deployed with this ARM template, view the following resource in a new tab: +++https://github.com/microsoft/azure-health-data-services-workshop/blob/main/resources/docs/FHIR-Starter_ARM_template_README.md#deployed-components+++

===

## Exercise 2: Set up Postman and test FHIR service

In the next part of this lab, you will

-   Visit another page and follow the instructions on setting up Postman.
-   Make API calls to test FHIR service using Postman.

1. [] To begin, open the Postman setup tutorial in a new browser tab using the URL: +++https://github.com/microsoft/azure-health-data-services-workshop/blob/main/resources/docs/Postman_FHIR_service_README.md+++

1. [] Follow the instructions and return here when finished.

>[!ALERT]Important: Store the **clientSecret Value** on your computer, not the **clientSecret ID** when you create your Postman app registration. That is the value you will need later in Postman when you fill in the clientSecret. You will not be able to get this value again. If you save the wrong item, you will have to create another secret.

>[!NOTE]A managed identity was automatically enabled for your FHIR service. That managed identity is what needs to be assigned the Storage Blob Data Contributor role in one of the ADLS Gen2 storage accounts in your resource group in future labs. The name of this storage account ends with "expsa".

What does success look like for Lab 7?

-   Other Azure resources for later labs successfully deployed. Template deployment must show no errors.
-   App registration created in Azure Active Directory for use with Postman and your FHIR service.
-   Postman set up and able to connect with your FHIR service.
    -   Capability Statement from your FHIR service – received.
